>>> [aug-19] tried running docker compose up to instantiate temporal server, but encountered an error:

Fatal Python error: config_get_locale_encoding: failed to get the locale encoding: nl_langinfo(CODESET) failed
Python runtime state: preinitialized

--
had to run `export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"`

>>> [aug-19] install temporal cli - https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/java/dev_environment/?build-tool=gradle&os=mac
